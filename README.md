## About

The system predicts the **severity of road accidents** based on various input factors using machine learning models. The goal is to enhance **smart transportation systems** by enabling proactive measures to reduce accident impacts.

## Problem Statement

Accurate prediction of accident severity can help in efficient allocation of emergency resources and improve traffic safety planning. Existing systems lack high-accuracy, real-time predictive capabilities. This project aims to fill that gap using ML techniques.

## Objectives

- Analyze the dataset for feature relevance using a correlation matrix.
- Train multiple ML algorithms to predict accident severity.
- Compare models based on performance metrics.
- Visualize results through confusion matrix, heatmap, and bar charts.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Preprocessing:** Null values removed (dataset had none initially)
- **Features:** Include weather, road conditions, vehicle type, special conditions, etc.

> **Note:**  
> - `Vehicle Type`: 1 = Lorry, 0 = Non-Lorry  
> - `Special Conditions`: 1 = Present, 0 = Not Present
